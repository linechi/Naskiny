  <p>Did you know I was secretly learning twitch for you? I’m still dogshit though. I wanna be a better twitch, but I just suck. I admire your skills with twitch, like when we used to play, it was so satisfying just watching you delete them like nothing. AP twitch looks so fun, but I don’t have the brains for it, but I will eventually get better, right!</p>
    <p>I wanted to make a Spotify playlist for you, but I feel like that might too much and you might take it as too much or you know, anyway, I hope you’re using Spotify to the fullest, I don’t have a problem with paying it, since we needed a member anyway. I hope you like it, you can join your other friends and listen to them.</p>
      <p>Hey! Did you know I like you? Like a lot… of course I do you dumbass, why wouldn’t I. It pains me when you don’t think you’re amazing, you’re literally the most awesome person in this World. I am not going to write more, because I literally wrote everything in the mental health thingy, I might’ve fucked up the whole thing, because I wrote it in the wrong folder, anyway haha, sorry! </p>
    <p>Enjoy your Christmas, don’t forget to claim the gift and checkout the mini game, I’m still having a hard time figuring it out and I think I spent way too much time on this just for it to be something so dumb and little. Whatever, I hope you like it either way </p>

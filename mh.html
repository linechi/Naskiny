        <p>About mental health, eventually it will get better. It might seem like it’s a never-ending cycle and you will be stuck, but you won’t be. I really advise you to go to the psychiatrist and talk about your emotions. Mood swings are hard to deal with, especially when you’re going through a lot of things, but I’m sure they can help you. I understand you fear being addicted to the pills, but trust me, I have experience over 10 years and when I wanted to stop, I did, but it all depends on you. Right now, I voluntarily choose to have pills, because I got one of the strongest ones and ngl, it helps me a lot. I wouldn’t say I’m addicted, because sometimes I either forget (and when you’re addicted, you usually think about it all the time, like oh hell yeah, let me go get some drugs, I need drugs :<). The pills stay in your body for three weeks. Anyway, I also want to apologize for being so emotional these days, lately I haven’t been doing so well and its killing me, but talking to you makes me feel better.
        <p>If you think you’re bipolar, which I also think you are, make sure to talk to a doctor about it and then maybe discuss what to do next. Being bipolar isn’t bad, it’s just another disorder that unfortunately makes your life a bit harder, but it’s nothing you can’t take care of! I am sure you will get through it.  You know, I have BPD and sometimes I view the world like its falling apart, but there are good days as well. Not every day is a struggle, or at least I’m trying to be positive about it. If you think too pessimistic, your life will seem harder, so try to stay positive for me, at least a little please. Don’t hurt yourself, I will always be here for you, and I don’t want to wake up with the feeling you’re gone :(. You’re precious, you know? You’re so amazing, I honestly caught feelings of the way you treat people, including me, and the way you always make sure I am doing fine, I really appreciate it, you’re so... perfect?! I love your personality and I also love it when you make little reactions when I tease you, it’s quite cute haha. I love your adorable smile; I love when I watch you roleplay and chop those niggas up. Oh, I love everything about you, you’re so talented, the way you know how to make bars?! Goddamn, what else? I can say so many things!
        <p>Sometimes I feel sad, because I feel like you will leave me, but I know it’s just the voices in my head telling me shit. Usually, I feel like I ruin everything, but you make sure to take care of me. How can someone who lives so far away make me happier than the people who live closer? Even though I am not ready for a relationship neither are you. It still makes me sad you live so far, it’s main factor of failing... but you know, I’ll wait years for you. Do you know this poem?

                <p style="color: #0a41e6">But if each day, each hour, you feel that you are destined for me with implacable sweetness,
                    if each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me,
                    ah my love, ah my own, in me all that fire is repeated,
                    in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
                    my love feeds on your love, beloved,
                    and as long as you live it will be in your arms without leaving mine. </p>

                <p>It’s about waiting months or years just to be with someone for one day, it‘s about the thing that values meaning over time. Isn’t it beautiful? Haha, this is all, please don‘t forget about me, I’ll always be there or here for you</p>
